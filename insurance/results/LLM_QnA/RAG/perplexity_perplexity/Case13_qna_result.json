Instead, WGS is addressed in a separate policy titled 'Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non-Oncology Conditions)'. To submit a claim for WGS, the provider must reference the specific UnitedHealthcare policy for WGS, ensure all clinical documentation supporting medical necessity is included, and follow any prior authorization or documentation requirements outlined in the WGS policy. The claim should not be submitted under the neuromuscular disorders genetic testing policy.",
