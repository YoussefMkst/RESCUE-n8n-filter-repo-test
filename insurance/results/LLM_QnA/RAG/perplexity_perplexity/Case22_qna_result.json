Documentation of specific cancer diagnosis in the proband(s) and pertinent medical records, including a summary of how the test will change the immediate care plan, may be required. The provider must confirm the basis for high-risk status, typically with a documented family history of breast or ovarian cancer. The laboratory should not proceed with testing until confirmation of coverage and precertification is received. If the member does not meet the pre-determined criteria, Aetna will contact the provider for review.",
