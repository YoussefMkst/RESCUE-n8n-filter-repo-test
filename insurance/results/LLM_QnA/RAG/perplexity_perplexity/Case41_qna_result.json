The requested limb-girdle muscular dystrophy panel is not covered under this policy. To submit a claim for a covered test, ensure the test is for FSHD, ordered by an appropriate specialist, and that the patient meets the clinical criteria for FSHD as outlined in the policy. Use the appropriate CPT code (81404) for FSHD testing if applicable. Always verify the member\u2019s specific benefit plan for additional requirements or preauthorization needs.",
