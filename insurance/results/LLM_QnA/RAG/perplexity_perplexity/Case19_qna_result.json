  "Q17": "According to the policy, for WGS to be considered medically necessary, the patient must have an unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorder, be evaluated by a clinical genetics expert, have potential for change in management, and meet one of three criteria: previous non-diagnostic genetic testing with strong clinical suspicion of genetic etiology, previous non-diagnostic testing where invasive procedures would otherwise be needed, or a clinical presentation that doesn't fit a well-described syndrome for which preferred testing is available. The patient in this case does not meet these criteria as chromosomal microarray and WES were not pursued first, and there are no structural or developmental concerns noted.",
