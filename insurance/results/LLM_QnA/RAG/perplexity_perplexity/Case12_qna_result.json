The policy specifically states that 'Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing are addressed in the Medical Policy titled Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non-Oncology Conditions).' The patient's clinical presentation does not meet criteria for a neuromuscular disorder panel as there is insufficient clinical evidence of a specific neuromuscular condition. The policy requires that testing be ordered by or in consultation with a board-certified medical geneticist, developmental pediatrician, or neurologist, which is not indicated in this case. Additionally, the patient lacks a high degree of suspicion for having a mitochondrial disease based on the limited clinical information provided.",
