  "Q17": "According to the policy, this test would not be covered as the patient does not meet medical necessity criteria. The policy requires that for multi-gene panel testing for neuromuscular disorders to be considered medically necessary, the patient must have clinical features consistent with a neuromuscular disorder. This patient has normal motor development with only poor athletic performance noted by a school psychologist, without clinical neurology referral, prior CK testing, or relevant family history. For proper consideration, the patient would need appropriate clinical workup including CK testing and neurological evaluation to establish suspicion of a specific neuromuscular disorder.",
