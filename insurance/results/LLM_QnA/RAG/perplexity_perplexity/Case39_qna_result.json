Use the appropriate CPT code(s) listed in the policy (e.g., 81413, 81414, etc.). Confirm that the patient's benefit plan covers genetic testing for cardiac ion channelopathies and submit all documentation as required by UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus. If preauthorization is required by the plan, obtain it prior to testing. Genetic counseling should be documented as provided or offered.",
