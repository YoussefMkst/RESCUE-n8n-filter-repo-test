Only targeted single gene tests or limited panels meeting strict criteria are considered medically necessary and reimbursable. Ensure all required documentation (ICD code, place of service, medical records) is included for any covered test. For WES, refer to the Exome Sequencing guideline, if available, and confirm prior authorization and coverage before proceeding.",
