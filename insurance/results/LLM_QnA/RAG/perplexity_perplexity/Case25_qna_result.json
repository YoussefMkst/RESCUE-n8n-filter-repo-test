  "Q17": "The policy does not list BRCA1/2 testing as a covered service for individuals with breast cancer, regardless of ancestry or age. The policy only addresses coverage for breast cancer gene expression profiling (GEP) tests (e.g., Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, Prosigna, EndoPredict, Breast Cancer Index) to inform treatment decisions in specific clinical scenarios. There is no mention of germline BRCA1/2 testing for hereditary cancer risk assessment or management. To submit a claim for BRCA1/2 testing, you would need to refer to a different UnitedHealthcare policy that specifically addresses hereditary cancer genetic testing. Under this policy, the claim would be denied as not covered.",
