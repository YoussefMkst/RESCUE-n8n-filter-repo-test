Ensure documentation includes evidence that the patient meets all medical necessity criteria: unexplained epilepsy and global developmental delay/intellectual disability with onset before age 18, negative prior chromosomal microarray, evaluation by a genetic counselor, and family history suggestive of a genetic etiology. Prior authorization is not required, but claims may be reviewed retrospectively to confirm criteria are met. Retain all supporting clinical documentation for potential review."
