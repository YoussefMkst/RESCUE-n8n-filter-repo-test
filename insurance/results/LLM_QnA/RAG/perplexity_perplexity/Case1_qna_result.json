  "Q17": "The test must be ordered by one of the approved provider types (medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician) rather than a genetic counselor. The policy requires that WES be ordered by specific types of specialists. Once ordered by an appropriate specialist, the claim should include documentation of the patient's clinical presentation (neurodevelopmental delay and seizures), prior negative chromosomal microarray test, and family history of neurodevelopmental disorders (brother with autism).",
