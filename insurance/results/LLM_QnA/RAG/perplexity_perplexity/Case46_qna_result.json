  "Q17": "Mitochondrial DNA sequencing is not addressed as a covered indication in the provided Aetna Pharmacogenetic and Pharmacodynamic Testing policy. The policy is limited to pharmacogenetic and pharmacodynamic tests related to drug response, and does not include coverage for mitochondrial DNA sequencing for the evaluation of suspected mitochondrial disease. To submit a claim, confirm if another Aetna policy (such as a general genetic testing policy) applies. If not, the claim is likely to be denied as not covered under this policy. Ensure all clinical documentation, specialist recommendations, and rationale for testing are included in the claim submission, and consider appeal if denied, referencing any other relevant Aetna policies if available.",
