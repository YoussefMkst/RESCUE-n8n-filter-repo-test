However, coverage is only provided if the patient meets medical necessity criteria, which include a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of cardiomyopathy or a qualifying family history. In this case, the patient does not meet these criteria, so the claim would be denied. If submitting, include all relevant clinical documentation and ensure the ordering provider is an approved specialist.",
