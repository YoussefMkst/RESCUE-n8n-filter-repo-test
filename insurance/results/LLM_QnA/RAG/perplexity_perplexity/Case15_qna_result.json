  "Q17": "Based on the policy document, the appropriate test would be a hereditary ataxia multigene panel rather than WGS. For a hereditary ataxia panel, the following steps would be required: 1) Pre- and post-test genetic counseling must be provided, 2) Documentation that no previous testing of requested genes has been performed, 3) No known mutation identified by previous analysis, 4) Documentation from ordering provider indicating how test results will directly impact medical care, 5) Confirmation that the member does not have a known underlying cause for ataxia, 6) Verification that family/medical history doesn't point to a specific genetic diagnosis that would warrant a more focused test, 7) Use of a qualified provider per Health Plan policy, 8) Submit with appropriate procedure code (81443, 81479, 0216U, or 0217U).",
