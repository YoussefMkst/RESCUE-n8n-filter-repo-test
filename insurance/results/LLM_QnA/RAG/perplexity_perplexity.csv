Case1,"Whole exome sequencing (WES) to investigate potential underlying genetic causes of neurodevelopmental delay and seizures. Specific gene content is not specified, as WES covers all protein-coding regions of the genome.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,ACMG,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,Diagnostic,Not specified,No,No,Yes,81415,No,Yes,"Submit the claim using the appropriate CPT code (81415) for standard exome sequencing. Ensure documentation includes evidence that the patient meets all medical necessity criteria: unexplained epilepsy and global developmental delay/intellectual disability with onset before age 18, negative prior chromosomal microarray, evaluation by a genetic counselor, and family history suggestive of a genetic etiology. Prior authorization is not required, but claims may be reviewed retrospectively to confirm criteria are met. Retain all supporting clinical documentation for potential review."
