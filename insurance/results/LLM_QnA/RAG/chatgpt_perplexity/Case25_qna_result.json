  "Q15.1": "The patient is a 38-year-old woman with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry recently diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer with no known family history of cancer. Her oncologist referred her for BRCA1/2 testing.",
  "Q16": "No",
  "Q17": "Based on the policy, BRCA1/2 testing is not specifically covered under this policy as it appears to be a germline genetic test rather than a somatic tumor test. The policy focuses on molecular oncology testing for solid tumors for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions. For BRCA1/2 testing, a different policy related to genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes would likely apply. The policy does mention that tumor testing may include BRCA mutations but in the context of comprehensive genomic profiling for treatment decisions in advanced cancer, not for germline testing.",
