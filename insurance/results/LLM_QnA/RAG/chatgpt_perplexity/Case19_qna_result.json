For POLG testing to be covered, the patient would need to meet specific clinical criteria outlined in the policy, including pre- and post-test genetic counseling and symptoms consistent with POLG-related disorders. The patient's current symptoms (fatigue and headaches) do not align with the policy's criteria for POLG testing. If the provider believes WGS is medically necessary, they would need to submit documentation showing how the patient meets Cigna's criteria for WGS testing, which is not included in the provided policy document.",
