The policy specifically states that 'Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing are addressed in the Medical Policy titled Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non-Oncology Conditions).' Additionally, the patient does not meet criteria for any covered neuromuscular genetic testing as she lacks sufficient clinical features of a neuromuscular disorder. The policy requires specific clinical presentations and prior testing before genetic testing would be considered. If the provider believes genetic testing is still warranted, they should document more specific neurological symptoms consistent with a neuromuscular disorder, and the test should be ordered by or in consultation with a board-certified medical geneticist, developmental pediatrician, or neurologist.",
