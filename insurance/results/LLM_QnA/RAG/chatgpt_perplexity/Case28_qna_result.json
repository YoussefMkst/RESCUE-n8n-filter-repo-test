  "Q17": "According to the policy, BRCA testing is only considered medically necessary if the member is at direct risk of inheriting the mutation (pre-symptomatic) and disease-specific criteria are met. The policy requires a first- or second-degree relative with breast, ovarian, or related cancers, or a known BRCA mutation in the family. A cousin with prostate cancer at age 67 does not meet these criteria. No claim should be submitted as the test is not covered for this scenario.",
