The policy requires unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorder with features such as developmental delay, intellectual disability, multiple congenital anomalies, or severe neuropsychiatric conditions. The patient only has generalized anxiety and mild behavioral issues, with no developmental delay, neurological findings, or organ malformations. If a claim is submitted, it will likely be denied. If submitting, include documentation of clinical features, prior evaluations, and genetic counseling, but coverage is not supported by policy.",
