The patient has no personal or family history of cancer and is requesting testing solely due to anxiety from media reports. The policy specifically addresses germline testing following somatic tumor testing, which is not applicable in this case. Standard clinical guidelines for BRCA testing typically require personal or family history of cancer, which this patient does not have.",
