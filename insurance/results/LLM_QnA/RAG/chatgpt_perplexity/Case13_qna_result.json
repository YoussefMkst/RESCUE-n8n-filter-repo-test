However, based on the policy, WGS is not covered for this indication under the neuromuscular disorders policy. Instead, consider submitting for a multi-gene targeted panel or whole mitochondrial genome sequencing, as these are considered medically necessary when ordered by a specialist and the clinical criteria are met. Refer to the member-specific benefit plan and confirm if prior authorization is required.",
