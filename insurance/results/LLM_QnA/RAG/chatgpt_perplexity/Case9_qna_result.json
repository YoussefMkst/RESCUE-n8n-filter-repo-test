  "Q17": "According to the policy, the appropriate testing approach would be to first perform chromosomal microarray and Fragile X testing as first-tier tests. The policy states that comprehensive panels for ASD/ID/GDD are considered experimental/investigational. For claim submission, the provider should document the formal diagnosis (which is currently lacking), clinical features that suggest a genetic cause, and how the results would alter medical management. The policy requires pre-test genetic counseling by an appropriate provider.",
