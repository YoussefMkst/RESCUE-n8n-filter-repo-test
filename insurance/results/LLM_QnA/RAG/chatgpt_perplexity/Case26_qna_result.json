However, based on the information provided, the test should be ordered by a hematologist or oncologist (which the OB/GYN referral satisfies). The patient meets criteria for testing based on her family history (mother with ovarian cancer at 47, maternal aunt with breast cancer at 42) and her Ashkenazi Jewish background, which are known risk factors for BRCA mutations. The claim should include appropriate documentation of the patient's family history and risk factors to support medical necessity.",
