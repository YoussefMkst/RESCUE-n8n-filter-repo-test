The patient has no personal or family history of breast, ovarian, or related cancers, and does not meet the >5% probability threshold for BRCA1/2 variants based on risk models. The policy explicitly states that testing for individuals who do not meet the specified criteria is considered investigational. If the patient still wishes to proceed with testing, she would likely be responsible for the full cost.",
