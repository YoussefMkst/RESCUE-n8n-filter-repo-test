  "Q17": "The policy requires that genetic testing for neuromuscular disorders be ordered for individuals with a suspected neuromuscular disorder based on clinical evaluation, typically after initial clinical assessment and relevant laboratory testing (e.g., CK, neurology referral). The test must be ordered by or in consultation with an appropriate specialist (e.g., neurologist, geneticist, developmental pediatrician). Documentation of medical necessity and clinical findings supporting suspicion of a neuromuscular disorder is required. In this case, the patient has not had a clinical neurology evaluation or relevant laboratory workup, and the test was not ordered by a specialist; therefore, the claim would not meet policy criteria for submission.",
