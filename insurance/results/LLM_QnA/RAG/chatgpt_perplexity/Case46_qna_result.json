  "Q17": "According to the Aetna Pharmacogenetic and Pharmacodynamic Testing policy, mitochondrial DNA sequencing is not listed as a covered test for any indication, including for patients with clinical suspicion of mitochondrial disease. The policy only covers specific pharmacogenetic and pharmacodynamic tests related to drug response and certain cancer therapies. To submit a claim, ensure the test is listed as covered in the policy, meets all medical necessity criteria, and that all required documentation (including clinical notes and specialist recommendations) is included. In this case, the test is not covered, so the claim would be denied under the current policy.",
