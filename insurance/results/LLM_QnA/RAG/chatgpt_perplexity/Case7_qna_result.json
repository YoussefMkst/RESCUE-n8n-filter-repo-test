For this patient, the test is being requested for general health screening and educational planning, which does not meet the medical necessity criteria. The policy requires that for WES to be covered, the patient must have an unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorder, previous genetic testing must be non-diagnostic, and there must be potential for a change in management and clinical outcome. The patient should also have been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics with counseling provided about potential risks.",
