(2) Confirm that the test is ordered by a Board-Certified or Board-Eligible Medical Geneticist or an appropriate independent provider, not a non-MD neuropsychologist. (3) Provide documentation that the patient meets all medical necessity criteria, including a clinical presentation that fits the policy\u2019s definition for unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorder, and that WGS will impact clinical management. (4) Ensure that pre- and post-test genetic counseling is provided by a qualified provider. (5) Submit the claim with the appropriate CPT code (81425) and all supporting documentation, including clinical notes, prior test results, and genetic counseling records.",
