  "Q17": "According to the policy, the appropriate test would be a hereditary ataxia multigene panel (not WGS). For that panel, the provider would need to document: 1) Pre- and post-test genetic counseling was provided, 2) No previous testing of requested genes, 3) No known mutation identified by previous analysis, 4) Patient has been diagnosed with cerebellar ataxia, 5) Documentation of how test results will directly impact medical care, 6) No known underlying cause for ataxia, 7) Family/medical history doesn't point to a specific genetic diagnosis. The claim should use appropriate panel procedure codes (81443, 81479, 0216U, or 0217U).",
