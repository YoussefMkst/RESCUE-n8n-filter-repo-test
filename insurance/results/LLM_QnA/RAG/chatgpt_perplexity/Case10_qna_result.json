  "Q17": "According to the policy, the appropriate first step would be chromosomal microarray testing (CMA) for this patient with speech delay. If CMA testing is performed and is non-diagnostic, and there remains a strong clinical suspicion of genetic etiology, then WES could be reconsidered. Prior to WES, the patient should be evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics and genetic counseling should be provided. Documentation should demonstrate how the test results would impact clinical management.",
