  "Q17": "The claim should include documentation of the patient's clinical features, prior genetic testing results (chromosomal microarray and WES), family history, and the clinical geneticist's recommendation. However, based on the policy, WGS is not covered in this scenario because the patient has already had both chromosomal microarray and WES with no pathogenic findings, and the policy does not support WGS as medically necessary after negative WES unless new evidence or clinical changes arise. The policy also requires that WGS is more efficient than targeted panels, which is not the case here. Submit the claim with all supporting documentation, but coverage is not supported by the policy.",
