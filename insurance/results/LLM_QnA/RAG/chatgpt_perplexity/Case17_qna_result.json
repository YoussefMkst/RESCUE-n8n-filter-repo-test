If the provider wishes to pursue testing, they would need to first perform appropriate prerequisite testing (such as CMA), document more severe clinical features, and have the test ordered by an appropriate specialist (medical geneticist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician) as specified in the policy. The patient's mild speech delay and classroom focus issues do not meet the policy's criteria for WGS, which requires more significant clinical presentations such as multiple congenital anomalies, moderate to profound intellectual disability, global developmental delay, or epileptic encephalopathy.",
