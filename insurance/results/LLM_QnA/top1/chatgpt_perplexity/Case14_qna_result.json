  "Q17": "The claim should be submitted with documentation of the patient's clinical features, prior genetic testing results (including microarray and WES), family history, and the clinical geneticist's recommendation. However, based on the policy, WGS is not covered in this scenario because the patient has already had chromosomal microarray and whole exome sequencing with no diagnosis, and the policy does not support WGS for further evaluation when a targeted panel (hereditary hearing loss panel) is more appropriate. The claim is likely to be denied unless a more targeted test is pursued and meets all policy criteria.",
