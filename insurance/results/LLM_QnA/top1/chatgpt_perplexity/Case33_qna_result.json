  "Q17": "The policy requires that germline BRCA1/2 testing be ordered for individuals who meet specific medical necessity criteria, such as a personal or family history suggestive of a germline mutation, a specific variant identified by somatic tumor testing, or other outlined scenarios. The patient does not meet these criteria. To submit a claim, ensure the test is ordered by an appropriate provider, document clinical and family history meeting policy criteria, and obtain any required prior authorization if specified by the plan. In this case, coverage is not supported for screening or 'peace of mind' testing without meeting medical necessity criteria.",
