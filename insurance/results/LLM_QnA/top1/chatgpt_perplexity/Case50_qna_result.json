  "Q17": "Based on the policy, the patient does not meet criteria for coverage of multi-gene panel testing. The policy requires that testing be ordered by or in consultation with a board-certified medical geneticist, developmental pediatrician, or neurologist. Additionally, the patient must have a high degree of suspicion of having a neuromuscular disorder based on medical history, family history, laboratory, or other clinical tests. In this case, the patient has normal motor development, no relevant family history, and the test was ordered by a school psychologist rather than a specialist. Prior to considering genetic testing, the policy would suggest appropriate clinical workup including CK testing and neurology referral.",
