  "Q17": "The policy document provided focuses on molecular oncology testing for hematologic cancers, not hereditary cancer testing like BRCA. For BRCA testing, the appropriate policy would be UnitedHealthcare's 'Genetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer' policy. Based on the search results, this patient would not meet criteria for BRCA testing as she has no personal history of cancer and no family history of BRCA-related cancers (breast, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate). Her family history of colon and stomach cancer does not meet criteria for BRCA testing according to standard guidelines. The claim would need to be submitted with appropriate CPT codes for BRCA testing along with documentation of medical necessity, which is not established in this case.",
