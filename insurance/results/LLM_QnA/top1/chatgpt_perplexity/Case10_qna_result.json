  "Q17": "The policy requires that chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) be performed as the first-line test for children with apparently nonsyndromic developmental delay. Whole exome sequencing (WES) may only be considered medically necessary if CMA or other first-line testing is non-diagnostic and the patient has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, with genetic counseling provided. To submit a claim for WES, documentation must show that CMA was performed and was non-diagnostic, and that all other policy criteria are met. Claims should include the appropriate CPT code (81415) and supporting clinical documentation.",
