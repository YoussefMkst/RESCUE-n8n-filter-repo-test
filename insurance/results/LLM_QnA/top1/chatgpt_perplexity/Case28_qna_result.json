The patient does not meet the medical necessity criteria: she has no personal history of cancer and her only family history is a cousin (not a first- or second-degree relative) with prostate cancer diagnosed at age 67, which does not meet the policy's disease-specific or family history criteria for BRCA testing. No claim should be submitted for coverage under this policy for this indication.",
