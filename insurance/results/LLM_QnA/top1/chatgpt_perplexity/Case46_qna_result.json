  "Q17": "The policy does not list mitochondrial DNA sequencing as a covered test under any indication, including for patients with clinical suspicion of mitochondrial disease. The policy is limited to pharmacogenetic and pharmacodynamic testing for specific drug-gene interactions, primarily in oncology and select other drug-response scenarios. To submit a claim, a provider would need to ensure the test is specifically listed as covered and meets all medical necessity criteria in the policy. Since mitochondrial DNA sequencing is not addressed or covered, the claim would not be approved under this policy.",
