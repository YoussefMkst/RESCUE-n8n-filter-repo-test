  "Q17": "According to the policy, WES is not covered for this patient. The policy specifically states that WES is addressed in a separate Medical Policy titled 'Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non-Oncology Conditions)'. For neuromuscular disorders, the policy requires specific clinical criteria to be met, including high suspicion of a mitochondrial disease, testing ordered by a board-certified medical geneticist, developmental pediatrician, or neurologist, and clinical features consistent with a mitochondrial disease. The patient's current presentation does not meet these criteria. Prior to considering any genetic testing, the patient should undergo standard clinical evaluations and targeted testing based on specific symptoms.",
