The patient has not had chromosomal microarray or a full conventional workup, and the ordering provider is a neuropsychologist (not an MD or geneticist). If coverage is sought, the patient must first complete all required conventional studies and be evaluated by an appropriate genetics specialist, with documentation of medical necessity and genetic counseling as outlined in the policy.",
