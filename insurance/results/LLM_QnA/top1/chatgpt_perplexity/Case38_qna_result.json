  "Q17": "According to the policy, the patient does not meet medical necessity criteria for BRCA testing. If the provider still believes testing is warranted, they would need to document why the patient might have a >5% probability of a BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant based on prior probability models (e.g., Tyrer-Cuzick, BRCAPro, CanRisk). The policy also states that genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience in genetic medicine and testing methods. If testing is pursued, it should be performed in a CLIA-licensed laboratory that offers comprehensive variant analysis.",
