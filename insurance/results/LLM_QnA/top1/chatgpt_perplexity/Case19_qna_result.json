  "Q17": "Based on the policy document, WGS is not covered for this patient. The policy only addresses POLG-related genetic testing for specific conditions. For POLG testing to be covered, the patient would need to meet specific diagnostic criteria outlined in the policy, including clinical examination consistent with POLG-related disorders or evaluation for valproate-induced hepatic toxicity with specific symptoms. The patient's presentation of fatigue and headaches without structural or developmental concerns does not meet these criteria. Additionally, pre and post-test genetic counseling would be required. If the provider believes POLG testing is indicated, they would need to document how the patient meets the specific criteria in the policy and obtain prior authorization.",
