The claim should include documentation of prior evaluations (metabolic screening, chromosomal microarray, WES), specialist consultation, and detailed clinical history. However, as whole genome sequencing is not covered for this indication under the current policy, the claim is likely to be denied unless the member-specific benefit plan document provides an exception.",
