  "Q17": "According to the policy, this genetic test would not be covered as the patient does not meet medical necessity criteria. The patient is asymptomatic with a normal ECG and no family history of cardiac disease. The policy states that genetic testing for cardiomyopathies is unproven and not medically necessary for all indications other than those specifically listed. If the provider still wishes to pursue testing, they should document why they believe it's medically necessary, ensure pre-test genetic counseling is completed, and submit appropriate documentation with the prior authorization request.",
