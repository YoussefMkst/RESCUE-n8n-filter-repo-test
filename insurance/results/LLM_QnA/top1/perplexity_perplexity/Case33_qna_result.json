  "Q17": "The policy requires that germline BRCA1/2 testing be considered medically necessary only if the patient meets specific criteria, such as a personal or family history suggestive of a germline mutation, a specific variant identified by somatic tumor testing, or other outlined scenarios. The patient does not meet these criteria. To submit a claim, ensure the test is ordered by an approved provider, document clinical and family history that meets policy criteria, and obtain any required prior authorization if specified by the plan. In this case, coverage is not supported, so the claim would likely be denied.",
