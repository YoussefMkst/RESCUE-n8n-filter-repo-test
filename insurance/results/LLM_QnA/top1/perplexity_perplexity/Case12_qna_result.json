For neuromuscular disorders, only multi-gene targeted panels (5 or more genes) for specific, clinically suspected neuromuscular disorders are considered medically necessary. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) is addressed under a separate policy and is not covered for this scenario. Submit all relevant clinical documentation, including specialist notes, prior test results, and evidence that prerequisite evaluations (such as more targeted panels) have been completed and were non-diagnostic. Claims for WES in this context will be denied unless all policy criteria are met and the appropriate policy is referenced.",
