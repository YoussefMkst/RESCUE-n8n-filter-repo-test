A different policy document titled 'Molecular Oncology Testing for Solid Tumor Cancer Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Treatment Decisions' would be needed to determine coverage for this patient's BRCA testing. The patient would need to meet criteria based on personal and family history of cancer, which based on the search results, she likely does not meet due to lack of family history and Ashkenazi Jewish background.",
