The policy requires that individuals meet specific criteria for BRCA testing, such as personal history of breast cancer diagnosed at age \u226450 years, family history of breast/ovarian cancer, or a probability of >5% of a BRCA1/2 variant based on prior probability models. The patient has no personal or family history of cancer, and there's no indication that she has a >5% probability of a BRCA variant. Additionally, while not explicitly required, the policy mentions genetic counseling in the Policy Guidelines section, which was not provided in this case.",
