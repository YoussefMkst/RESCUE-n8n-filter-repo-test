The patient has no symptoms, normal ECG, and no family history of cardiac disease. The policy specifically states that genetic testing for cardiomyopathies is unproven and not medically necessary for indications outside those specifically listed. Pre-test genetic counseling is strongly recommended per the policy, which does not appear to have been provided in this case. If the provider still believes testing is warranted, they would need to document medical necessity that aligns with the policy criteria.",
