  "Q17": "The policy requires that all medical necessity criteria be met for coverage, including: (1) the patient must display clinical features or be at direct risk of inheriting the mutation; (2) the result of the test must directly impact treatment; (3) after history, physical exam, pedigree analysis, genetic counseling, and conventional diagnostic studies, a definitive diagnosis remains uncertain and a specific diagnosis is suspected; and (4) disease-specific criteria must be met. For arrhythmia panels, coverage is only provided for patients with confirmed or suspected inherited arrhythmia syndromes (e.g., long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) who meet strict clinical criteria (such as abnormal ECG, syncope, family history of sudden cardiac death, or other high-risk features). For claim submission, documentation must include clinical features, relevant family history, prior diagnostic workup, and how the test will impact management. In this case, the patient does not meet the policy's medical necessity criteria, so the claim would be denied.",
