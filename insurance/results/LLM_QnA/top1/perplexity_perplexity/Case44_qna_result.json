  "Q17": "To submit the claim, ensure the test is ordered by a qualified specialist (e.g., pediatric cardiologist), document the patient's clinical presentation (recurrent exertional syncope, QTc prolongation, T-wave alternans, and family history of sudden cardiac death), and include the relevant ICD-10 diagnosis code (e.g., I45.81 for Long QT syndrome). Use the appropriate CPT code (81413 or S3861) for the LQTS gene panel. Attach clinical notes supporting medical necessity and, if required by the health plan, evidence of genetic counseling. Check the member\u2019s specific Aetna PPO plan for any additional requirements or preauthorization steps, as the policy notes that benefit determinations are ultimately governed by the member\u2019s health benefit plan.",
