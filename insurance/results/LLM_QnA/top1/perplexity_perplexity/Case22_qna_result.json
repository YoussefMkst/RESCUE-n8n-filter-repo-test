  "Q17": "According to the policy, the patient does not meet medical necessity criteria for BRCA1/BRCA2 testing. The policy requires genetic counseling before testing, which was not provided. If the physician believes the patient's risk exceeds 5% based on a validated model (Tyrer-Cuzick, BRCAPro, CanRisk), documentation of this calculation should be submitted. Additionally, the policy states that genetic testing should be performed in a setting with appropriate pre- and post-test counseling. To proceed, the patient should receive formal genetic counseling and have risk assessment using a validated model to determine if she meets the >5% threshold for BRCA1/2 mutation probability.",
