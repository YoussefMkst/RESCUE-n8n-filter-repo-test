Claims must include the appropriate ICD code, place of service, and any other information necessary for automated processing. Claims for comprehensive panels or exome sequencing for isolated developmental delay or mild language delay without prior targeted testing (e.g., chromosomal microarray, Fragile X) will not be reimbursed. If submitting for a covered test, ensure the rendering laboratory is a qualified provider per the Health Plan policy.",
