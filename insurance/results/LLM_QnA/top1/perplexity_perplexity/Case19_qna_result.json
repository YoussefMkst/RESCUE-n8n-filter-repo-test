  "Q17": "According to the policy, the patient does not meet the medical necessity criteria for WGS. The policy requires that for standard WGS to be considered medically necessary, the patient must have an unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorder, be evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, have potential for change in management, and meet one of three specific criteria including previous non-diagnostic genetic testing with strong clinical suspicion of genetic etiology, previous non-diagnostic testing where invasive procedures would otherwise be faced, or a clinical presentation that doesn't fit a well-described syndrome. The patient in this case has fatigue and headaches without structural or developmental concerns, which does not meet these criteria. Prior testing such as chromosomal microarray analysis should be pursued first.",
