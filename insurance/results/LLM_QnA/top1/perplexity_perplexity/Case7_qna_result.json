  "Q17": "The policy requires that WES be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. The patient must have a nonspecific clinical presentation that doesn't fit a well-defined syndrome for which a specific gene test is available. The patient must have one of the following: multiple congenital anomalies affecting different organ systems, moderate/severe/profound intellectual disability diagnosed by age 18, global developmental delay, or epileptic encephalopathy with onset before age 3; OR two or more of the other qualifying features listed in the policy. The test must be expected to directly influence medical management and clinical outcomes. Prior authorization documentation should include detailed clinical information showing how these criteria are met.",
