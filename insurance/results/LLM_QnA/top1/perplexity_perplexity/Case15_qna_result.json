For coverage, the following would be required: 1) Pre- and post-test genetic counseling, 2) Documentation that the patient has cerebellar ataxia, 3) Documentation that there is no known underlying cause for the ataxia, 4) Documentation from the ordering provider indicating how test results will directly impact medical care, 5) Confirmation that no previous testing of the requested genes has been performed, and 6) Verification that the rendering laboratory is a qualified provider per Health Plan policy.",
