The patient has not been diagnosed with epilepsy, seizures, or any of the specific conditions listed in the policy (early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, infantile spasms, intractable neonatal seizures, drug-resistant focal epilepsy, etc.). Additionally, there's a mismatch between the patient's actual insurance (Aetna) and the policy document provided (Cigna).",
