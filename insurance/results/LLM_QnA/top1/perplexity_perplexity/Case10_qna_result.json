  "Q17": "The policy requires that chromosomal microarray (CMA) be performed first for children with developmental delay unless CMA is unavailable or not appropriate for the clinical presentation. Whole exome sequencing may only be considered if CMA and other first-line testing are non-diagnostic and the patient has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, with genetic counseling provided. To submit a claim, ensure that all policy prerequisites are met, including documentation of prior CMA testing and genetic counseling, and use the appropriate CPT code (81415) if criteria are met. Otherwise, the claim will be denied as not medically necessary.",
