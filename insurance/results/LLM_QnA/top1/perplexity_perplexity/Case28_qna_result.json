The patient does not have a first- or second-degree relative with breast, ovarian, or related cancers, nor a known familial BRCA mutation. The cousin with prostate cancer at age 67 does not meet the policy's threshold for coverage. If a claim is submitted, it will be denied as not medically necessary under the current policy.",
