  "Q15.1": "The policy specifically addresses molecular testing for solid tumors including breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, melanoma, and other cancers. The patient information describes a 38-year-old woman with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry recently diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer, for whom BRCA1/2 testing was recommended.",
  "Q16": "No",
  "Q17": "According to the policy, BRCA1/2 testing is not specifically covered under this policy. The policy states it applies to tests that have not been granted approval as an FDA cleared or approved Companion Diagnostic. For breast cancer, the policy covers gene expression profiling tests like MammaPrint, Oncotype Dx Breast, Prosigna, Breast Cancer Index, and EndoPredict for specific situations, but not BRCA testing. BRCA testing would likely fall under a different genetic testing policy. The provider should verify if BRCA testing is covered under a different UnitedHealthcare policy specifically addressing hereditary cancer testing.",
