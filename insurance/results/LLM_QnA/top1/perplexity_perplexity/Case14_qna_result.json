  "Q17": "Based on the policy document, WGS is not specifically listed as a covered test for hearing loss. The policy outlines coverage for specific gene tests (GJB2, GJB6, MT-RNR1, MT-TS1) and multigene panels for nonsyndromic hearing loss. The patient has already had chromosomal microarray and WES with negative results. If further genetic testing is desired, a hearing loss multigene panel (CPT 81430 for sequencing and 81431 for deletion/duplication) would be the appropriate next step according to the policy, rather than WGS. The claim should include documentation of the patient's bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, absence of known cause, and absence of syndromic features (though the patient's cleft palate and developmental delay suggest possible syndromic hearing loss).",
