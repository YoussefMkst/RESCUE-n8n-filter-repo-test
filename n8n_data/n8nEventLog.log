It can be diagnosed when a child is delayed in one or more milestones, categorised into motor skills, speech, cognitive skills, and social and emotional development. There is usually a specific condition which causes this delay, such as cerebral palsy, Fragile X syndrome or other chromosomal abnormalities. However, it is sometimes difficult to identify this underlying condition.\\nOther terms associated with this condition are failure to thrive (which focuses on lack of weight gain and physical development), intellectual disability (which focuses on intellectual deficits and the changes they cause to development) and developmental disability (which can refer to both intellectual and physical disability altering development).\\n\\n\\n== Causes ==\\nDevelopmental delay can be caused by learning disabilities, in which case the delay can usually be overcome with time and support - such as with physiotherapists, occupational therapists, vision therapists, and speech and language therapists. Other causes which may cause a permanent delay in development include genetic disorders such as Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome and GLUT1 Deficiency Syndrome; childhood infections such as meningitis or encephalitis, and metabolic disorders such as hypothyroidism. Metabolic disorders are more likely to cause delayed development in older children, as many congenital metabolic problems which are easily managed are screened for in the neonatal period. Child born prematurely (born before 37 weeks). The use of toxic substances in pregnancy, particularly alcohol, can lead to developmental delay if they affect the neurological development of the fetus, such as in fetal alcohol syndrome. Even though there are many known causes of delay, some children will never receive a diagnosis.\\n\\n\\n== Diagnosis ==\\nDevelopmental monitoring is performed during wellness visits to check a child's development. Health authorities encourage parents to monitor their child's development, the CDC's program \\\"Learn the Signs. Act Early\\\" provides materials for a child's development is assessed based on expected milestones for actions like how they play, learn, speak, act and move. Missed milestones may be cause for concern, so the doctor or another specialist may call for a more thorough test or exam to take a closer look, this is usually done by going through Developmental Screening.\\nDevelopmental Screening is a more involved process. The evaluating professional will ask a parent to complete a research-based questionnaire that asks about a child's development, including language, movement, thinking, behavior, and emotions. Developmental Screening is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to all children at 9, 18, and 30 months. The AAP also recommends that all children be screened specifically for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during regular well-child visits at 18 and 24 months. If a Developmental Screening indicates a delay, the child should then be assessed with a Developmental Evaluation.\\nDevelopmental Evaluations are performed by a Developmental pediatrician, child psychologist, or other trained provider with the purpose of Identifying and diagnosing developmental delays and conditions.\\n\\nChromosome microarray and karyotyping to look for trisomy, microdeletions, and duplications. It is the most sensitive diagnostic test available and is used first line in all cases, but can miss balanced translocations and low-level mosaicism.\\nSpecific gene testing is available for certain disorders such as Rett syndrome, although these are expensive tests which aren't widely available\\nSelective metabolic investigations may be useful in the absence of other identifiable causes, and the specific tests done will depend on the presentation. Inborn errors of metabolism causing metabolic disorders are rare and there are \"}"}}

These genes are associated with various syndromes that involve developmental delay or intellectual disability.\\nTool: The information provided suggests that NIPBL, NSD1, KMT2D, and KDM6A are genes associated with developmental delay or intellectual disability. However, it's important to consult a medical professional or genetic counselor for a comprehensive understanding of genetic conditions and associated genes.\\nTool: Page: Global developmental delay\\nSummary: Global developmental delay is an umbrella term used when children are significantly delayed in two or more areas of development. It can be diagnosed when a child is delayed in one or more milestones, categorised into motor skills, speech, cognitive skills, and social and emotional development. There is usually a specific condition which causes this delay, such as cerebral palsy, Fragile X syndrome or other chromosomal abnormalities. However, it is sometimes difficult to identify this underlying condition.\\nOther terms associated with this condition are failure to thrive (which focuses on lack of weight gain and physical development), intellectual disability (which focuses on intellectual deficits and the changes they cause to development) and developmental disability (which can refer to both intellectual and physical disability altering development).\\n\\n\\n== Causes ==\\nDevelopmental delay can be caused by learning disabilities, in which case the delay can usually be overcome with time and support - such as with physiotherapists, occupational therapists, vision therapists, and speech and language therapists. Other causes which may cause a permanent delay in development include genetic disorders such as Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome and GLUT1 Deficiency Syndrome; childhood infections such as meningitis or encephalitis, and metabolic disorders such as hypothyroidism. Metabolic disorders are more likely to cause delayed development in older children, as many congenital metabolic problems which are easily managed are screened for in the neonatal period. Child born prematurely (born before 37 weeks). The use of toxic substances in pregnancy, particularly alcohol, can lead to developmental delay if they affect the neurological development of the fetus, such as in fetal alcohol syndrome. Even though there are many known causes of delay, some children will never receive a diagnosis.\\n\\n\\n== Diagnosis ==\\nDevelopmental monitoring is performed during wellness visits to check a child's development. Health authorities encourage parents to monitor their child's development, the CDC's program \\\"Learn the Signs. Act Early\\\" provides materials for a child's development is assessed based on expected milestones for actions like how they play, learn, speak, act and move. Missed milestones may be cause for concern, so the doctor or another specialist may call for a more thorough test or exam to take a closer look, this is usually done by going through Developmental Screening.\\nDevelopmental Screening is a more involved process. The evaluating professional will ask a parent to complete a research-based questionnaire that asks about a child's development, including language, movement, thinking, behavior, and emotions. Developmental Screening is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to all children at 9, 18, and 30 months. The AAP also recommends that all children be screened specifically for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during regular well-child visits at 18 and 24 months. If a Developmental Screening indicates a delay, the child should then be assessed with a Developmental Evaluation.\\nDevelopmental Evaluations are performed by a Developmental pediatrician, child psychologist, or other trained provider with the purpose of Identifying and diagnosing developmental delays and conditions.\\n\\nChromosome microarray and karyotyping to look for trisomy, microdeletions, and duplications. It is the most sensitive diagnostic test available and is used first line in all cases, but can miss balanced translocations and low-level mosaicism.\\nSpecific gene testing is available for certain disorders such as Rett syndrome, although these are expensive tests which aren't widely available\\nSelective metabolic investigations may be useful in the absence of other identifiable causes, and the specific tests done will depend on the presentation.

In DM, muscles are often unable to relax after contraction. Other manifestations may include cataracts, intellectual disability and heart conduction problems. In men, there may be early balding and infertility. While myotonic dystrophy can occur at any age, onset is typically in the 20s and 30s.\\nMyotonic dystrophy is caused by a genetic mutation in one of two genes. Mutation of the DMPK gene causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Mutation of CNBP gene causes type 2 (DM2). DM is typically inherited, following an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, and it generally worsens with each generation. A type of DM1 may be apparent at birth. DM2 is generally milder. Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing.\\nThere is no cure. Treatments may include braces or wheelchairs, pacemakers and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. The medications mexiletine or carbamazepine can help relax muscles. Pain, if it occurs, may be treated with tricyclic antidepressants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\\nMyotonic dystrophy affects about 1 in 2,100 people, a number that was long estimated to be much lower (often cited as 1 in 8,000), reflecting that not all patients have immediate symptoms and, once they do have symptoms, the long time it typically takes to get to the right diagnosis. It is the most common form of muscular dystrophy that begins in adulthood. It was first described in 1909, with the underlying cause of type 1 determined in 1992.\\n\\n\\n== Signs and symptoms ==\\n\\nDM causes muscle weakness, early onset of cataracts, and myotonia, which is delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction. Cataracts can be either a cortical cataract with a blue dot appearance, or a posterior subcapsular cataract. Other organs affected include the heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and brain. Insulin resistance can also occur. Signs and symptoms vary considerably by severity, unusual phenotype, and form (DM1/DM2). DM1 and DM2 differ in regards to the muscles they affect, age of onset, severity of disease, and extramuscular manifestations.\\n\\n\\n=== DM1 ===\\nDM1 usually begins in the muscles of the hands, feet, neck, or face. One manifestation of facial weakness is drooping of the eyelid (ptosis). It slowly progresses to involve other muscle groups, including the heart. Myotonia tends to be more prominent in DM1 compared to DM2. Other DM1 manifestations include problems with executive function (e.g., organization, concentration, word-finding) and hypersomnia. Abnormalities in the electrical activity of the heart are common in DM1, manifesting as arrhythmias or conduction blocks. Sometimes, dilated cardiomyopathy occurs. Symptoms onset any time from birth to adulthood. The earlier the disease onset, the greater the variety of possible signs and symptoms.  Thus, various diagnostic classifications based on the age of onset/severity of the disease have been proposed, although DM1 manifestations likely lie on a continuum.\\n\\n\\n==== Congenital DM1 ====\\nWhen DM1 onsets at birth, it is called congenital DM1. Manifestations that can be present at birth include hypotonia, respiratory failure, feeding difficulty, and club foot (talipes equinovarus), any of which tend to resolve over several years.

If you have a specific gene or genetic association in mind, it would be best to consult a medical professional or a genetic counselor for accurate information.\\nAI: \\nTool: Page: Myotonic dystrophy\\nSummary: Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a type of muscular dystrophy, a group of genetic disorders that cause progressive muscle loss and weakness. In DM, muscles are often unable to relax after contraction. Other manifestations may include cataracts, intellectual disability and heart conduction problems. In men, there may be early balding and infertility. While myotonic dystrophy can occur at any age, onset is typically in the 20s and 30s.\\nMyotonic dystrophy is caused by a genetic mutation in one of two genes. Mutation of the DMPK gene causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Mutation of CNBP gene causes type 2 (DM2). DM is typically inherited, following an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, and it generally worsens with each generation. A type of DM1 may be apparent at birth. DM2 is generally milder. Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing.\\nThere is no cure. Treatments may include braces or wheelchairs, pacemakers and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. The medications mexiletine or carbamazepine can help relax muscles. Pain, if it occurs, may be treated with tricyclic antidepressants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\\nMyotonic dystrophy affects about 1 in 2,100 people, a number that was long estimated to be much lower (often cited as 1 in 8,000), reflecting that not all patients have immediate symptoms and, once they do have symptoms, the long time it typically takes to get to the right diagnosis. It is the most common form of muscular dystrophy that begins in adulthood. It was first described in 1909, with the underlying cause of type 1 determined in 1992.\\n\\n\\n== Signs and symptoms ==\\n\\nDM causes muscle weakness, early onset of cataracts, and myotonia, which is delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction. Cataracts can be either a cortical cataract with a blue dot appearance, or a posterior subcapsular cataract. Other organs affected include the heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and brain. Insulin resistance can also occur. Signs and symptoms vary considerably by severity, unusual phenotype, and form (DM1/DM2). DM1 and DM2 differ in regards to the muscles they affect, age of onset, severity of disease, and extramuscular manifestations.\\n\\n\\n=== DM1 ===\\nDM1 usually begins in the muscles of the hands, feet, neck, or face. One manifestation of facial weakness is drooping of the eyelid (ptosis). It slowly progresses to involve other muscle groups, including the heart. Myotonia tends to be more prominent in DM1 compared to DM2. Other DM1 manifestations include problems with executive function (e.g., organization, concentration, word-finding) and hypersomnia. Abnormalities in the electrical activity of the heart are common in DM1, manifesting as arrhythmias or conduction blocks. Sometimes, dilated cardiomyopathy occurs. Symptoms onset any time from birth to adulthood. The earlier the disease onset, the greater the variety of possible signs and symptoms.  Thus, various diagnostic classifications based on the age of onset/severity of the disease have been proposed, although DM1 manifestations likely lie on a continuum.\\n\\n\\n==== Congenital DM1 ====\\nWhen DM1 onsets at birth, it is called congenital DM1. Manifestations that can be present at birth include hypotonia, respiratory failure, feeding difficulty, and club foot (talipes equinovarus), any of which tend to resolve over several years. During childhood, intellectual impairment, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) can result. Gastrointestinal issues can result, which can be severe, manifestations including diarrhea, constipation, and fecal incontinence. The symptoms of adult DM often manifest during adolescence. Infantile DM1 can be distinguished as another disease category, or it can be grouped with congenital DM1 or childhood-onset DM1.\\n\\n\\n==== Childhood-onset DM1 ====\\nChildhood-onset DM1 is defined as onset of symptoms between ages 1 and 10 years.

In DM, muscles are often unable to relax after contraction. Other manifestations may include cataracts, intellectual disability and heart conduction problems. In men, there may be early balding and infertility. While myotonic dystrophy can occur at any age, onset is typically in the 20s and 30s.\\nMyotonic dystrophy is caused by a genetic mutation in one of two genes. Mutation of the DMPK gene causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Mutation of CNBP gene causes type 2 (DM2). DM is typically inherited, following an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, and it generally worsens with each generation. A type of DM1 may be apparent at birth. DM2 is generally milder. Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing.\\nThere is no cure. Treatments may include braces or wheelchairs, pacemakers and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. The medications mexiletine or carbamazepine can help relax muscles. Pain, if it occurs, may be treated with tricyclic antidepressants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\\nMyotonic dystrophy affects about 1 in 2,100 people, a number that was long estimated to be much lower (often cited as 1 in 8,000), reflecting that not all patients have immediate symptoms and, once they do have symptoms, the long time it typically takes to get to the right diagnosis. It is the most common form of muscular dystrophy that begins in adulthood. It was first described in 1909, with the underlying cause of type 1 determined in 1992.\\n\\n\\n== Signs and symptoms ==\\n\\nDM causes muscle weakness, early onset of cataracts, and myotonia, which is delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction. Cataracts can be either a cortical cataract with a blue dot appearance, or a posterior subcapsular cataract. Other organs affected include the heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and brain. Insulin resistance can also occur. Signs and symptoms vary considerably by severity, unusual phenotype, and form (DM1/DM2). DM1 and DM2 differ in regards to the muscles they affect, age of onset, severity of disease, and extramuscular manifestations.\\n\\n\\n=== DM1 ===\\nDM1 usually begins in the muscles of the hands, feet, neck, or face. One manifestation of facial weakness is drooping of the eyelid (ptosis). It slowly progresses to involve other muscle groups, including the heart. Myotonia tends to be more prominent in DM1 compared to DM2. Other DM1 manifestations include problems with executive function (e.g., organization, concentration, word-finding) and hypersomnia. Abnormalities in the electrical activity of the heart are common in DM1, manifesting as arrhythmias or conduction blocks. Sometimes, dilated cardiomyopathy occurs. Symptoms onset any time from birth to adulthood. The earlier the disease onset, the greater the variety of possible signs and symptoms.  Thus, various diagnostic classifications based on the age of onset/severity of the disease have been proposed, although DM1 manifestations likely lie on a continuum.\\n\\n\\n==== Congenital DM1 ====\\nWhen DM1 onsets at birth, it is called congenital DM1. Manifestations that can be present at birth include hypotonia, respiratory failure, feeding difficulty, and club foot (talipes equinovarus), any of which tend to resolve over several years. During childhood, intellectual impairment, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) can result. Gastrointestinal issues can result, which can be severe, manifestations including diarrhea, constipation, and fecal incontinence. The symptoms of adult DM often manifest during adolescence. Infantile DM1 can be distinguished as another disease category, or it can be grouped with congenital DM1 or childhood-onset DM1.\\n\\n\\n==== Childhood-onset DM1 ====\\nChildhood-onset DM1 is defined as onset of symptoms between ages 1 and 10 years. Manifestations include the\\nAI: \\nTool: I don't have specific information about the congenital myotonic dystrophy genes based on the provided context.

In DM, muscles are often unable to relax after contraction. Other manifestations may include cataracts, intellectual disability and heart conduction problems. In men, there may be early balding and infertility. While myotonic dystrophy can occur at any age, onset is typically in the 20s and 30s.\\nMyotonic dystrophy is caused by a genetic mutation in one of two genes. Mutation of the DMPK gene causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Mutation of CNBP gene causes type 2 (DM2). DM is typically inherited, following an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, and it generally worsens with each generation. A type of DM1 may be apparent at birth. DM2 is generally milder. Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing.\\nThere is no cure. Treatments may include braces or wheelchairs, pacemakers and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. The medications mexiletine or carbamazepine can help relax muscles. Pain, if it occurs, may be treated with tricyclic antidepressants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\\nMyotonic dystrophy affects about 1 in 2,100 people, a number that was long estimated to be much lower (often cited as 1 in 8,000), reflecting that not all patients have immediate symptoms and, once they do have symptoms, the long time it typically takes to get to the right diagnosis. It is the most common form of muscular dystrophy that begins in adulthood. It was first described in 1909, with the underlying cause of type 1 determined in 1992.\\n\\n\\n== Signs and symptoms ==\\n\\nDM causes muscle weakness, early onset of cataracts, and myotonia, which is delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction. Cataracts can be either a cortical cataract with a blue dot appearance, or a posterior subcapsular cataract. Other organs affected include the heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and brain. Insulin resistance can also occur. Signs and symptoms vary considerably by severity, unusual phenotype, and form (DM1/DM2). DM1 and DM2 differ in regards to the muscles they affect, age of onset, severity of disease, and extramuscular manifestations.\\n\\n\\n=== DM1 ===\\nDM1 usually begins in the muscles of the hands, feet, neck, or face. One manifestation of facial weakness is drooping of the eyelid (ptosis). It slowly progresses to involve other muscle groups, including the heart. Myotonia tends to be more prominent in DM1 compared to DM2. Other DM1 manifestations include problems with executive function (e.g., organization, concentration, word-finding) and hypersomnia. Abnormalities in the electrical activity of the heart are common in DM1, manifesting as arrhythmias or conduction blocks. Sometimes, dilated cardiomyopathy occurs. Symptoms onset any time from birth to adulthood. The earlier the disease onset, the greater the variety of possible signs and symptoms.  Thus, various diagnostic classifications based on the age of onset/severity of the disease have been proposed, although DM1 manifestations likely lie on a continuum.\\n\\n\\n==== Congenital DM1 ====\\nWhen DM1 onsets at birth, it is called congenital DM1. Manifestations that can be present at birth include hypotonia, respiratory failure, feeding difficulty, and club foot (talipes equinovarus), any of which tend to resolve over several years. During childhood, intellectual impairment, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) can result. Gastrointestinal issues can result, which can be severe, manifestations including diarrhea, constipation, and fecal incontinence. The symptoms of adult DM often manifest during adolescence. Infantile DM1 can be distinguished as another disease category, or it can be grouped with congenital DM1 or childhood-onset DM1.\\n\\n\\n==== Childhood-onset DM1 ====\\nChildhood-onset DM1 is defined as onset of symptoms between ages 1 and 10 years. Manifestations include the\\nAI: \\nTool: I don't have specific information about the congenital myotonic dystrophy genes based on the provided context.

In DM, muscles are often unable to relax after contraction. Other manifestations may include cataracts, intellectual disability and heart conduction problems. In men, there may be early balding and infertility. While myotonic dystrophy can occur at any age, onset is typically in the 20s and 30s.\\nMyotonic dystrophy is caused by a genetic mutation in one of two genes. Mutation of the DMPK gene causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Mutation of CNBP gene causes type 2 (DM2). DM is typically inherited, following an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, and it generally worsens with each generation. A type of DM1 may be apparent at birth. DM2 is generally milder. Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing.\\nThere is no cure. Treatments may include braces or wheelchairs, pacemakers and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. The medications mexiletine or carbamazepine can help relax muscles. Pain, if it occurs, may be treated with tricyclic antidepressants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\\nMyotonic dystrophy affects about 1 in 2,100 people, a number that was long estimated to be much lower (often cited as 1 in 8,000), reflecting that not all patients have immediate symptoms and, once they do have symptoms, the long time it typically takes to get to the right diagnosis. It is the most common form of muscular dystrophy that begins in adulthood. It was first described in 1909, with the underlying cause of type 1 determined in 1992.\\n\\n\\n== Signs and symptoms ==\\n\\nDM causes muscle weakness, early onset of cataracts, and myotonia, which is delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction. Cataracts can be either a cortical cataract with a blue dot appearance, or a posterior subcapsular cataract. Other organs affected include the heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and brain. Insulin resistance can also occur. Signs and symptoms vary considerably by severity, unusual phenotype, and form (DM1/DM2). DM1 and DM2 differ in regards to the muscles they affect, age of onset, severity of disease, and extramuscular manifestations.\\n\\n\\n=== DM1 ===\\nDM1 usually begins in the muscles of the hands, feet, neck, or face. One manifestation of facial weakness is drooping of the eyelid (ptosis). It slowly progresses to involve other muscle groups, including the heart. Myotonia tends to be more prominent in DM1 compared to DM2. Other DM1 manifestations include problems with executive function (e.g., organization, concentration, word-finding) and hypersomnia. Abnormalities in the electrical activity of the heart are common in DM1, manifesting as arrhythmias or conduction blocks. Sometimes, dilated cardiomyopathy occurs. Symptoms onset any time from birth to adulthood. The earlier the disease onset, the greater the variety of possible signs and symptoms.  Thus, various diagnostic classifications based on the age of onset/severity of the disease have been proposed, although DM1 manifestations likely lie on a continuum.\\n\\n\\n==== Congenital DM1 ====\\nWhen DM1 onsets at birth, it is called congenital DM1. Manifestations that can be present at birth include hypotonia, respiratory failure, feeding difficulty, and club foot (talipes equinovarus), any of which tend to resolve over several years. During childhood, intellectual impairment, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) can result. Gastrointestinal issues can result, which can be severe, manifestations including diarrhea, constipation, and fecal incontinence. The symptoms of adult DM often manifest during adolescence. Infantile DM1 can be distinguished as another disease category, or it can be grouped with congenital DM1 or childhood-onset DM1.\\n\\n\\n==== Childhood-onset DM1 ====\\nChildhood-onset DM1 is defined as onset of symptoms between ages 1 and 10 years. Manifestations include the\"}"}}

In DM, muscles are often unable to relax after contraction. Other manifestations may include cataracts, intellectual disability and heart conduction problems. In men, there may be early balding and infertility. While myotonic dystrophy can occur at any age, onset is typically in the 20s and 30s.\\nMyotonic dystrophy is caused by a genetic mutation in one of two genes. Mutation of the DMPK gene causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Mutation of CNBP gene causes type 2 (DM2). DM is typically inherited, following an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, and it generally worsens with each generation. A type of DM1 may be apparent at birth. DM2 is generally milder. Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing.\\nThere is no cure. Treatments may include braces or wheelchairs, pacemakers and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. The medications mexiletine or carbamazepine can help relax muscles. Pain, if it occurs, may be treated with tricyclic antidepressants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\\nMyotonic dystrophy affects about 1 in 2,100 people, a number that was long estimated to be much lower (often cited as 1 in 8,000), reflecting that not all patients have immediate symptoms and, once they do have symptoms, the long time it typically takes to get to the right diagnosis. It is the most common form of muscular dystrophy that begins in adulthood. It was first described in 1909, with the underlying cause of type 1 determined in 1992.\\n\\n\\n== Signs and symptoms ==\\n\\nDM causes muscle weakness, early onset of cataracts, and myotonia, which is delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction. Cataracts can be either a cortical cataract with a blue dot appearance, or a posterior subcapsular cataract. Other organs affected include the heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and brain. Insulin resistance can also occur. Signs and symptoms vary considerably by severity, unusual phenotype, and form (DM1/DM2). DM1 and DM2 differ in regards to the muscles they affect, age of onset, severity of disease, and extramuscular manifestations.\\n\\n\\n=== DM1 ===\\nDM1 usually begins in the muscles of the hands, feet, neck, or face. One manifestation of facial weakness is drooping of the eyelid (ptosis). It slowly progresses to involve other muscle groups, including the heart. Myotonia tends to be more prominent in DM1 compared to DM2. Other DM1 manifestations include problems with executive function (e.g., organization, concentration, word-finding) and hypersomnia. Abnormalities in the electrical activity of the heart are common in DM1, manifesting as arrhythmias or conduction blocks. Sometimes, dilated cardiomyopathy occurs. Symptoms onset any time from birth to adulthood. The earlier the disease onset, the greater the variety of possible signs and symptoms.  Thus, various diagnostic classifications based on the age of onset/severity of the disease have been proposed, although DM1 manifestations likely lie on a continuum.\\n\\n\\n==== Congenital DM1 ====\\nWhen DM1 onsets at birth, it is called congenital DM1. Manifestations that can be present at birth include hypotonia, respiratory failure, feeding difficulty, and club foot (talipes equinovarus), any of which tend to resolve over several years. During childhood, intellectual impairment, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) can result. Gastrointestinal issues can result, which can be severe, manifestations including diarrhea, constipation, and fecal incontinence. The symptoms of adult DM often manifest during adolescence. Infantile DM1 can be distinguished as another disease category, or it can be grouped with congenital DM1 or childhood-onset DM1.\\n\\n\\n==== Childhood-onset DM1 ====\\nChildhood-onset DM1 is defined as onset of symptoms between ages 1 and 10 years.

Symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, abdominal distension, and weight loss. Complications outside of the gastrointestinal tract may include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and fatigue. The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction may occur as a complication of chronic inflammation, and those with the disease are at greater risk of colon cancer and small bowel cancer.\\nAlthough the precise causes of Crohn's disease (CD) are unknown, it is believed to be caused by a combination of environmental, immune, and bacterial factors in genetically susceptible individuals. It results in a chronic inflammatory disorder, in which the body's immune system defends the gastrointestinal tract, possibly targeting microbial antigens. While Crohn's is an immune-related disease, it does not seem to be an autoimmune disease (the immune system is not triggered by the body itself). The exact underlying immune problem is not clear; however, it may be an immunodeficiency state.\\nAbout half of the overall risk is related to genetics, with more than 70 genes involved. Tobacco smokers are three times as likely to develop Crohn's disease as non-smokers. It often begins after gastroenteritis. Other conditions with similar symptoms include irritable bowel syndrome and Behçet's disease.\\nThere is no known cure for Crohn's disease. Treatment options are intended to help with symptoms, maintain remission, and prevent relapse. In those newly diagnosed, a corticosteroid may be used for a brief period of time to improve symptoms rapidly, alongside another medication such as either methotrexate or a thiopurine used to prevent recurrence. Cessation of smoking is recommended for people with Crohn's disease. One in five people with the disease is admitted to the hospital each year, and half of those with the disease will require surgery at some time during a ten-year period. While surgery should be used as little as possible, it is necessary to address some abscesses, certain bowel obstructions, and cancers. Checking for bowel cancer via colonoscopy is recommended every few years, starting eight years after the disease has begun.\\nCrohn's disease affects about 3.2 per 1,000 people in Europe and North America; it is less common in Asia and Africa. It has historically been more common in the developed world. Rates have, however, been increasing, particularly in the developing world, since the 1970s. Inflammatory bowel disease resulted in 47,400 deaths in 2015, and those with Crohn's disease have a slightly reduced life expectancy. It tends to start in adolescence and young adulthood, though it can occur at any age. Males and females are equally affected.\\n\\n\\n== Name controversy ==\\nThe disease was named after gastroenterologist Burrill Bernard Crohn, who in 1932, together with Leon Ginzburg (1898–1988) and Gordon D. Oppenheimer (1900–1974) at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, described a series of patients with inflammation of the terminal ileum of the small intestine, the area most commonly affected by the illness. Why the disease was named after Crohn has controversy around it. While Crohn, in his memoir, describes his original investigation of the disease, Ginzburg provided strong evidence of how he and Oppenheimer were the first to study the disease.\\n\\n\\n== Signs and symptoms ==\\n\\n\\n=== Gastrointestinal ===\\n\\nMany people with Crohn's disease have symptoms for years before the diagnosis. The usual onset is in the teens and twenties, but can occur at any age. Because of the 'patchy' nature of the gastrointestinal disease and the depth of tissue involvement, initial symptoms can be more subtle than those of ulcerative colitis. People with Crohn's disease experience chronic recurring periods of flare-ups and remission. The \"}"}}

Symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, abdominal distension, and weight loss. Complications outside of the gastrointestinal tract may include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and fatigue. The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction may occur as a complication of chronic inflammation, and those with the disease are at greater risk of colon cancer and small bowel cancer.\\nAlthough the precise causes of Crohn's disease (CD) are unknown, it is believed to be caused by a combination of environmental, immune, and bacterial factors in genetically susceptible individuals. It results in a chronic inflammatory disorder, in which the body's immune system defends the gastrointestinal tract, possibly targeting microbial antigens. While Crohn's is an immune-related disease, it does not seem to be an autoimmune disease (the immune system is not triggered by the body itself). The exact underlying immune problem is not clear; however, it may be an immunodeficiency state.\\nAbout half of the overall risk is related to genetics, with more than 70 genes involved. Tobacco smokers are three times as likely to develop Crohn's disease as non-smokers. It often begins after gastroenteritis. Other conditions with similar symptoms include irritable bowel syndrome and Behçet's disease.\\nThere is no known cure for Crohn's disease. Treatment options are intended to help with symptoms, maintain remission, and prevent relapse. In those newly diagnosed, a corticosteroid may be used for a brief period of time to improve symptoms rapidly, alongside another medication such as either methotrexate or a thiopurine used to prevent recurrence. Cessation of smoking is recommended for people with Crohn's disease. One in five people with the disease is admitted to the hospital each year, and half of those with the disease will require surgery at some time during a ten-year period. While surgery should be used as little as possible, it is necessary to address some abscesses, certain bowel obstructions, and cancers. Checking for bowel cancer via colonoscopy is recommended every few years, starting eight years after the disease has begun.\\nCrohn's disease affects about 3.2 per 1,000 people in Europe and North America; it is less common in Asia and Africa. It has historically been more common in the developed world. Rates have, however, been increasing, particularly in the developing world, since the 1970s. Inflammatory bowel disease resulted in 47,400 deaths in 2015, and those with Crohn's disease have a slightly reduced life expectancy. It tends to start in adolescence and young adulthood, though it can occur at any age. Males and females are equally affected.\\n\\n\\n== Name controversy ==\\nThe disease was named after gastroenterologist Burrill Bernard Crohn, who in 1932, together with Leon Ginzburg (1898–1988) and Gordon D. Oppenheimer (1900–1974) at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, described a series of patients with inflammation of the terminal ileum of the small intestine, the area most commonly affected by the illness. Why the disease was named after Crohn has controversy around it. While Crohn, in his memoir, describes his original investigation of the disease, Ginzburg provided strong evidence of how he and Oppenheimer were the first to study the disease.\\n\\n\\n== Signs and symptoms ==\\n\\n\\n=== Gastrointestinal ===\\n\\nMany people with Crohn's disease have symptoms for years before the diagnosis. The usual onset is in the teens and twenties, but can occur at any age. Because of the 'patchy' nature of the gastrointestinal disease and the depth of tissue involvement, initial symptoms can be more subtle than those of ulcerative colitis. People with Crohn's disease experience chronic recurring periods of flare-ups and remission.
